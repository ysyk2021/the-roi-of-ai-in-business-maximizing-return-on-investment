To maximize the ROI of AI investments, businesses must understand the basic concepts and principles of ROI analysis. In this chapter, we will explore these concepts and principles to help businesses understand how to measure the ROI of their AI investments.

What is ROI?
------------

ROI stands for Return on Investment, which is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment. It represents the amount of profit or loss generated by an investment relative to the amount of money invested.

How is ROI Calculated?

The formula for calculating ROI is:

ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) x 100

Where Net Profit is the total revenue generated from the investment minus the total cost of the investment, and Total Investment is the total cost of the investment.
